# DataCarbon.info

DataCarbon.info is a frontend application designed to calculate CO2 emissions and associated environmental costs for data transmission. Unlike EcoTime, this application does not rely on geolocation. Instead, users input the data quantity and the number of units to be transmitted. They also have the option to specify their regional CO2 intensity.

The app functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring offline accessibility, and can be downloaded on both desktop and smartphone platforms.

## Demo

You can access a live demo of the application at [datacarbon.info](http://datacarbon.info).

## Usage

Using DataCarbon.info is straightforward. There is no need for compilation or script execution. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser, whether locally or on a server.
